cstatus pipe line (as already done)
    check that coda is turned on and convo is ended properly
    next from track and not overiterated
    check that adjacent is taken both from intent and state

    get full state and get full intent in utils

    convread - nice flexible exporting (cstatus interface dependency)
    convread prompt - history

________________________________________________________________________________
    function calling - dynamically create the functions dict
    intent reco
    prompt says
    global reflection and prompting

how to manipulate context from under - this is in prompting the says part
    - if a state is emphasised, it doesnt receive context
    - emphasise a state and give at an entirely misleading prompt
    - how to manipulate whether previous conversation is provided - emphasis

    convread peek   - nice readable output
    convread debug  - flexible cstatus

cstatus interface - list convos and within convos list cstatuses
